Some Spark implementations of clustering algorithms.

	- the word code refers to the SOM clustering  and BiTM (Biclustering Topological Map) codes.

	- the word AUTHORS stand for LIPN (Le Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris-Nord (LIPN) (UMR 7030)) 
	
	- The code may be reproduced for personal use only. In particular, any copy addressed to a third party, even free of charge, would be fraudulent.

	- If modifications are performed on the code, these modifications will  be communicated to the AUTHORS and I commit myself to transfer their	property to the AUTHORS.

	- Publication about any work realized using the code must mention it.
